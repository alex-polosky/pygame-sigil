Now here's an idea:
Once I get the console working, here's what'll happen:
1) press ctrl+tilde to bring up the console
2) type in "godmode" 1; <- activates invincibility/unlimited whatever
3) press ctrl+shift+alt+g
4) Brings up a dialog, asking for password
5) enter "supergodmode enabled"
6) flashes "I Am A God" on the console, and brings up a mouse cursor
7) press ctrl+tilde to put back the console
8) All AI is now paused, and you can click on everything to change properties, or drag wherever you want

When in SuperGodMode, you can bring up the console, and type the following commands:
 - save: saves the map in it's current state
 - load: loads the map in it's default state
 - destroy: destroys the object you selected
 - exit: exits SuperGodMode
